/// Intro ////

This workshop is all about the basic of React.
You can use this course material for your own future project
but please note that this course intentionally opts out all advanced and new react add-ons,features,and dependencies.

The main reason is that the code best practices on React is becoming more complicated.
Before knowing how to crawl, you cannot run. The main goal of this course is having you understand the very fundamental concepts.

Don't be too much stressed even if you are not grabbing the core concepts immediately.
It takes time to understand them. If you have a rough gasp of what React is about through this course, This will be already a huge win.
